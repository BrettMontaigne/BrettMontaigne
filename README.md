## Brett Montaigne  */mɔ̃.tɛn/*

I'm a software engineer with broad interests in distributed ledger tech and artificial intelligence.

### 🔭 I'm currently working on:

* **AI + Web3**: I'm currently researching and developing methods to use web3 technologies to add monetization strategies to modern AI models.  

### 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on:

* The intersection of artificial intelligence and web3 technologies to increase AI capabilities and broaden adoption 
* Innovative application and productization of autonomous LLMs (e.g. AutoGPT)

### 🌍 Languages:
I prefer developing in languages with fast HTTP libraries and short development turnaround times (e.g. Golang, Python). 

If something here has helped you and you'd like to send me some gas money (ETH!):
