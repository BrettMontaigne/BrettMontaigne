## Brett Montaigne  */mɔ̃.tɛn/*

I'm a software engineer who loves to create innovative and profitable algorithmic trading strategies on different blockchains. I'm always learning and have a broad interest in math and physics.

### 🔭 I'm currently working on:

* **AI + Web3**: I'm currently researching and developing methods to use web3 technologies to add monetization strategies to modern AI models.  
  
* **Tiber Protocol**: Tiber is a prototype liquid staking protocol on Algorand, currently developing in collaboration with peers in the 2022 International School of Algorand Smart Contracts.

* **Cryptocurrency Trading**: I'm working on arbitrage trading strategies that employ more sophisticated frontrunning defenses such as intermediate states, submarine sends, tx counters, etc. I'm also exploring interfaces like atomic flash loans and flash minting to turn algorithms into GigaWhales. 🐋

* **Machine Learning**: I have experience feature engineering vectors from real-time market data, and building production-quality end-to-end machine learning models with compute clusters like Amazon EMR and Apache Spark. I'm currently working on a data model that leverages these tools with multiprocessing and in-memory aggregations for very fast high-frequency arbitrage.

### 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on:

* The intersection of artificial intelligence and web3 technologies to increase AI capabilities and broaden adoption 
* Generalizing smart contract decoding strategies beyond Solidity
* High Frequency Arbitrage Strategies
* Novel Flash Loan and Flash Mint Implementations
* Mempool MEV Defensive Strategies

### 🌍 Languages:
I prefer developing in languages with fast HTTP libraries and short development turnaround times (e.g. Golang, Python). 
Somehow I end up scaffolding a lot of new ideas in Node.js regardless.
However, I do hold a special place in my heart for functional languages like Scala.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
* I'm overclocking all cycles on TEAL and the Algorand development ecosystem
* Current trends in the ETH Smart Contracts dev stack: Solidity, Truffle, OpenZeppelin, Infura.io, Vyper, Chainlink, etc.

### 🧘 Philosophy: 
> Zero-sum is symmetry; find the asymmetry.
